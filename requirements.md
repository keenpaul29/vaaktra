# Vāktra Programming Language Project Plan

## Notes
- User wants to build the most powerful programming language, based entirely on Sanskrit.
- The language must be faster than C++ or Java, with modern features.
- Project should be built from scratch for maximum optimization.
- Statically typed, ahead-of-time compiled, memory safe, zero-cost abstractions, modern concurrency.
- Core project structure and crates (README, Cargo.toml, lexer, parser, AST, span module) have been created.
- Project and language renamed to Vāktra (वाक्त्र).
- Vedic Sanskrit vocabulary and concepts (from Vedas, mantras, Puranas) are being integrated into the language design and lexer.
- Integration of Vedic Sanskrit vocabulary and concepts into the lexer and language design is complete.
- User requests deep integration of all Sanskrit concepts, JIT compilation, advanced memory management, and every parameter for maximal speed and power.
